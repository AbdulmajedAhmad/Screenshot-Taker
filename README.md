# Screenshot-Taker
A script to take a screenshot and put it in the right folder and in the right order, and arrange other screenshots automatically.

I'm using this script with i3WM, such that when I press "PrtScr" button script will run..
(If you want so: add this line to your i3 config file:
  "binsym PrtScr exec python /PATH/TO/SCRIPT/screenshot_i3.py")
